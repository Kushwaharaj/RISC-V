RISC-V CPU Implementation (Verilog HDL)
Designed and implemented a single-cycle 32-bit RISC-V CPU core, compliant with RV32I ISA, capable of executing R, I, S, B, J, and U-type instructions.
Developed a modular architecture, including components such as the ALU, register file, control unit, data, and instruction memory.
Implemented data memory with load/store instructions supporting byte, half-word, and word accesses.
Optimized CPU modules for resource efficiency in FPGA implementation, including memory and branch handling mechanisms.
Tools used: Verilog HDL, Quartus, ModelSim.
